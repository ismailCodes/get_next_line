# get_next_line
The aim of this project was to make a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

This project allowed me to add a very convenient function to my collection,
and also allowed me to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming:
static variables.
I also gained a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the
stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the
unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.
